OGS Android
===========

This is an android application to play games on
[online-go.com](online-go.com). It is still early in development so there may
be bugs and half-implemented features. I use it daily for making
correspondence moves on a tablet and sometimes a phone, so it works reasonably
well.

The main reason to use this over the website is the ability to have the first
click zoom the board so that the stones can be placed with more accuracy. This
allows 19x19 games to be easily played on even a small screen such as a phone.
